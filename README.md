#WELCOME TO YOUR FIRST GIT

Hello!!!
Welcome

i am still trying to figure github out , i have been able to figure out git , now i just need to figure out how to push to github and i should start pushung with no problem 

i have been using git on my terminal and just trying to get used to the CL (command line)

sooo far i am still on my journey to figuring out github haha , but i am doing well at git , i use it everyday to track and save changes to my code to help me plan my code

Well i am still having challenges pushing to github , maybe i need to commit a whole day to trying to solve this problem , but i am currently working on somethings which is taking my time 

after spending 5 hours straight on css , doind deep woork ,its safe to say css is very deep!! , that is why people run away from front end but not me.

consistency is key!

coding in a manner you understand is very key , try not to over complicate things for yourself , and walk your way into new ways , keep trying till you understand , and dont stop coding 

And finally i have been able to figure out github , thanks to my instructor at HIIT PLC , i can start pushing some projects that i have worked on 

This is how you come alive and change your world
again 

javacript math methods / functions like math.round() , math.floor() , math.ceil() , were a bit confusing at first for me but not anymore 
well i am participating in a hackthon wish myself luck 

i think i mightt be getting ahead of myself , do i need to go back to javascript and not abandon it for this Hackathon , there will always be others 

javascript just getting crazy each time

I have taken a few days to really practice and learn javascript well and is has been amazing , just keep practicing and it will be easier.  also i just need to leave the hard part and come back later to it with a fresh mind and i will figure it out 

Using DOMS to query and interact with my HTML document
Another day trying to work with javascript and fresh what i have learnt soo far

practicing node.js

another practice for node.js

Starting a new project for HIIT

its been a while since i came here to give an update , i have finined another static for Hiit , i just went through all i have done so far , and i need to practice more

now its times go over all the codes and projects we have done so far , and pratice alone side 

still going over the things ive done sooo far from my class github repo

lets learn and code some more 


API's and ferch Api are a bit diffreent

fetch api is a tool that is usied to manage requests and response
with certain protocals 
while API's are what make software / client wnd server side interact with each other 

i have finished the front end of all my recent projects i am working on
i will start the functionality of these projects ones i am ready

working on this blog and estate website together and it is crazy 

i have been able to handle most of the javascript for the signup and login form 

trying to figure out the javascript in this RE project and myy head os going crazy 
maybe i should jusr refer to old code , that might help instead of trying to write new code and confuse myself 
Making use of template literals is wayyyy better than creating tags and elements again with all the stress of javascript 
i am meant to look at mysql as well and go into it knowing more of the basics 

this script is really confusing me , i feel soo confused right now at 4:37am 28 dec 2023 Lord help me
lets try and figure out the script on this real estate website

trying to work on these two projects are a but stressful 
took a whole day off all my prjects and i am back too try and work it out 
what i was avoiding has caught me , i might have to use javascript to creating the list of properties again 
i have been able too create the list of the properties using javacript 
now i am going to spend soometime looking at postman just to grasp the basics before the end of tthe year 
and mysql

i left all my projects soo far and went to play around with postman and get used to its interface
also pratciced a few thing with postman by using a random book API on github
