#WELCOME TO YOUR FIRST GIT

Hello!!!
Welcome

i am still trying to figure github out , i have been able to figure out git , now i just need to figure out how to push to github and i should start pushung with no problem 

i have been using git on my terminal and just trying to get used to the CL (command line)

sooo far i am still on my journey to figuring out github haha , but i am doing well at git , i use it everyday to track and save changes to my code to help me plan my code

Well i am still having challenges pushing to github , maybe i need to commit a whole day to trying to solve this problem , but i am currently working on somethings which is taking my time 

after spending 5 hours straight on css , doind deep woork ,its safe to say css is very deep!! , that is why people run away from front end but not me.

consistency is key!

coding in a manner you understand is very key , try not to over complicate things for yourself , and walk your way into new ways , keep trying till you understand , and dont stop coding 

And finally i have been able to figure out github , thanks to my instructor at HIIT PLC , i can start pushing some projects that i have worked on 

This is how you come alive and change your world
